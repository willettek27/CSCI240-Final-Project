					<td class="description"> An Orchestra is comprised of various instruments. These instruments are classified into four broad categories: strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion.
						String instruments contain the violin, viola, cello, harp, and bass. Woodwinds have flute, oboe, clarinet, and bassoon. Brass contain trumpet, French Horn, Trombone, and Tuba. 
						While the Percussion instruments are composed of many instruments but the main instruments are the Timpani, Triangle, symbols, and drums. 
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="background">
					<td class="description"> 
						Each section in the string intruments has a section leader that helps the rest of their section. 
					This means that they help with bowings and queues when entering in the piece. However, the first chair of the First violin section is called the Concertmaster. 
					That person is in charge of the whole Orchestra. They are similar to a second in-command to the Conductor. 
					They help the overall Orchestra in queueing in enterances and help with bowings to help all the bowsing match.
					However, the band section works differently than the string section.	
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td class="description">
						Unlike the string section where there is more than one person on a part, the band section has only one person on each part. They are basically in charge of themselves. 
						They must know their queues and know their part well because they cannot cover their mistakes at all unlike string instruments.
